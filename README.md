Dotfiles and few ideas/plugins I use to maintain my scripts and configuration.

## Installation
I store my dotfiles in Git on my own GitLab server at home. On any computer with zsh I clone my repository in `~/.dotfiles`

```bash
git clone \
    ssh://git@gitlab.example.com/Joaquin6/repo.git \
    ~/.dotfiles \
    --recursive
```
